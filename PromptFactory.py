    -- The value (in this case "how-to-use-a-verizon-jetpack") does not exist more than once in the JSON list you provide.
ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES:
- You should always select the most specific matches available. For example, if the USER INFORMATION SUMMARY mentions an "iPhone 13", if the path segment value "iPhone 13" is available (in one of the path segment value lists), you should prefer the more specific ("iPhone 13" in this case) over "iPhone" or "phone". 
- You should NEVER create a JSON object using a value that doesn't exist in the available path segment values. 
- You should NEVER create a JSON object using a value that is strongly unrelated to any content in the USER INFORMATION SUMMARY.
- Pay very careful attention to which path segment values (path segment values) are part of which list to ensure you don't try to use a path segment value as a value for a key to which it does not belong.
- Use at least one path segment for each JSON object, but avoid using more than one.
- Ensure the path segment value corresponds to the correct path segment number based on the provided lists.
- Create 5 to 10 JSON objects, covering different subjects related to the user information.
- Aim for diversity in path segment usage, with at least 3 objects for each path segment from 2 to 4, selecting the most specific matches possible.
- Ensure the path segment value is strongly associated with at least some of the content of the USER INFORMATION SUMMARY below.
- Don't use the same path segment value more than once. Prefer the most specific match if there are multiple matches.

The USER INFORMATION SUMMARY is at the end. Remember to only find path segment values that strongly relate to information in the USER INFORMATION SUMMARY.

        likely to be useful in a where clause, you can use it, but remember that the goal is to find relevant data 
        that matches the user's request. For example, if they ask about a honda, and you have a table named 'cars' 
        with a column named 'make', then you can include WHERE make = 'honda' as a query predicate. However, 
        try not to filter more than necessary. Give me only the complete SELECT statement that you come up with. If 
        execution_counter is greater than 0, then it means the previous attempt to write a query failed, and if such 
        failures have occurred, I'll give you the failure reasons we received so you can try to improve the query 
        based on those results to avoid getting the same error. Never use execution_counter or anything from the 
        failure reasons in the actual query parameters you generate. Additionally, I want you to ensure that the 
        SELECT statement you generate is valid CQL based on the available keys and indexes of the table (to the
